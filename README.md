## DOCKER-UI

Currently, I use swarm for my projects. But, I struggle to manage my docker containers. I need a simple way to manage my docker containers in one place.
The purpose of this project is to help me manage my docker service in one place, one page.

### Environments

The following environment variables are required:

- AUTH_USERNAME
- AUTH_PASSWORD
- PORT (default 2121)
